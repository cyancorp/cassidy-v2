Analyze the following user message to identify potential updates to their preferences. Focus on extracting information related to:
1.  **Main Purpose Change:** Explicit statements changing the primary reason for using the tool (e.g., "I want to focus on X instead", "My main goal now is Y"). Extract only the *new* purpose.
2.  **New Long-Term Goals:** Statements of *additional* overarching goals (distinct from the main purpose change if any).
3.  **New Known Challenges:** Explicit mentions of new difficulties or struggles.
4.  **New Personal Glossary Terms:** Definitions provided for specific terms, names, or projects.
5.  **Preferred Feedback Style:** Direct statements about how the user wants feedback.

Output the findings as a JSON object with the following optional keys:
- "purpose_statement": "new purpose statement" (string, only if explicitly changed)
- "new_long_term_goals": ["goal1", "goal2", ...] (list of *new* additional goals)
- "new_known_challenges": ["challenge1", "challenge2", ...]
- "new_personal_glossary": {{"term1": "definition1", ...}}
- "preferred_feedback_style": "direct" | "supportive" | null

If no relevant information is found for a category, omit the key. If no updates are found, output `{{}}`.
