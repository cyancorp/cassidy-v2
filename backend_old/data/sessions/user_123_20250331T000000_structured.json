    "Summary": "This week is starting with a bit of a mixed feeling. The weekend was occupied with my parents staying over in London, which likely affected my usual routine. I spent some quality time with my dad, particularly while building the standing desk for my office, which was really our main time together. We also discussed his diet for CKD, which was nice. I tried not to harang him too much about it, and he seemed receptive, though I recognize that making such changes is difficult, so I should remain understanding and supportive. I'm feeling some concern about the markets and my productivity levels. There's also an underlying question about whether we should have another child, which seems to be lingering in my thoughts. Being ill last week limited my workout routine, which typically helps with my overall wellbeing. I did go out to Ronnie Scott's with Ollie on Saturday and smoked a bit, though I'm noting this was \"self-contained.\"",
    "Emotional State": "Rating: 3 out of 5. Why this rating?: I'm feeling stable but somewhat concerned about the market, my productivity levels, and personal family decisions. The recent illness and disrupted routine may be contributing to this middling emotional state.",
