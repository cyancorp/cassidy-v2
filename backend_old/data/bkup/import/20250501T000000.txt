### Journal Entry - May 1, 2025

#### Open Reflection
This week's journal entry is somewhat abbreviated as I've been ill for the past few days, having caught a virus from Oscar who also has had conjunctivitis. With him being off nursery this week, I've needed to look after him, which has limited my productivity. Despite this, spending time with him is always a joy.

The market situation has been weighing heavily on my mind, and I find myself oscillating between different perspectives. From a bullish standpoint, the market seems to have digested much of the volatility stemming from Trump's policies and has seemingly discounted the notion that tariffs will remain and damage the economy. Additionally, the AI boom presents a strong bullish argument - Scott Alexander's paper predicting AGI by 2027 suggests massive benefits potentially accruing to the major tech companies (the Magnificent 7). However, Yann LeCun from Meta contends that LLMs will never achieve AGI, arguing that we need models that go beyond language to model the world more directly.

The term AGI itself is somewhat vague. The real question is whether there will be massive productivity gains driving up major tech company share prices in the next few years. After considering this, I'm less confident because we've already witnessed considerable AI hype. Though the momentum might continue for a while longer.

On the bearish side, we could be heading into a recession, not just from Trump's growth-constraining domestic policies, but also due to technical indicators like the 2-year/10-year bond curve, which turned positive and historically precedes a recession by approximately 6 months.

Considering the more generally bullish perspective that "stonks go up," we've just experienced a 20% dip. In retrospect, my action at that point should have been to buy into the dip in my pension and ISA accounts while remaining risk-off in my trading account. I need clearer rules around this - a 20% dip is healthy, but technically this does appear to be a bear market rally.

The market influencers I follow are generally bearish. Lord Fed believes this is a bear market rally. Thiccy has lost about £13,000 of my money in the hyper liquid account attempting to short this market. Giver's Hyper Liquid Vault has been short and is losing money maintaining that position. I'm grateful I haven't been actively shorting here, though I have significantly reduced exposure, leaving me with deployable cash. I'm uncertain about the tactical approach for deployment, unsure whether this will be a sustained upward movement.

Another interesting development is the relative strength of Bitcoin versus SPX. Bob Loukas's cycle theory suggests that a new 60-day cycle has started on Bitcoin. This could be used as a hard stop for a long Bitcoin position around 95, stopping out at the recent low - though that would be a brutal stop out. I'd prefer to be buying at those lower levels, which means potentially setting an earlier stop out around the 90 level. This highlights the need for a clear distinction between trades and long-term investments, as I'm more comfortable stopping out a trade at 90 if I'm simultaneously buying for the long-term portfolio (like SPX) at those levels.

There's also an emerging narrative about Bitcoin potentially decoupling from SPX, as it can function both as a safe haven and a risk asset. This narrative has gained popularity recently, even though both SPX and Bitcoin have rallied this week, not showing clear decoupling yet.

#### Emotional State
**Rating**: 3 out of 5  
**Why this rating?**: Despite being ill and having limited productivity due to caring for Oscar, spending time with him has been enjoyable. Market uncertainty is creating some stress, but having cash available for deployment provides some security. Overall feeling moderate with mixed factors affecting my emotional state.
