### Journal Entry 1 - March 23, 2025

This week has been productive with completing purchase for the new office and planning layout, including purchasing some essential equipment like a table and monitor. Completed the first Vibe Coding article and the new atchai.com website is nearly ready, pending hero images. Also secured a crypto accountant named Zach who will help reconcile finances by next week.

#### Emotional State
**Rating**: 3.5-4 out of 5  
**Why this rating?**: Feeling positive about progress on various fronts, particularly with the office planning and website development.

#### Trading Journal
Trades This Week:
- SPX 0-day trade on XSP (Friday): 5645/5650 call spread, Lord fed trade. Reached maximum gain at expiry.

#### Market Thoughts:
- Much downside already priced in with tariffs
- Positioning has come off significantly
- Bearish sentiment is prevalent
- Consensus view that alts cannot be held long-term due to supply creation
- SPX only ~7% off highs
- Bitcoin in mid-80s from high of 108 (around 20-25% decline)
- ETH and alts have declined more severely
- Possibly near a bottom for alts - may make a good mean reversion play
- Still significant market uncertainty (possible recession, tariffs, Trump headlines)
- Base case: 6-12 months of depression/chop before bull market resumes (Q2-Q4 2025)
- Potential risks: bad inflation, poor growth numbers, stagflation, Trump's government spending cuts

#### Strategy Considerations:
- Currently positioned with ~30% of net worth in cash
- Need to reduce Solana exposure (down from 300 to 120-130)
- Consider moving Solana position into Bitcoin
- Focus on timing short-term mean reversion trades
- Watch for Michael Saylor buying Bitcoin next week
- Potentially enter Bitcoin long next week if conditions look favorable
