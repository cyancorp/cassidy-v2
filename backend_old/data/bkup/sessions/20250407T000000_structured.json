    "Open Reflection": "This week has been challenging, particularly with the market downturn. The SPX is down to around 5,000 and Bitcoin is hovering around 76. A significant personal concern has been Oscar's health, as he became ill with vomiting and diarrhea, requiring a visit to A&E over the weekend. Fortunately, he's showing signs of recovery now.\n\nOn a positive note, I've made progress with the office setup, purchasing a rug, desk, acoustic panels, and a sofa. I have a clearer vision for the studio layout now. I completed my planned tax loss harvesting last week by selling positions I had targeted. Despite market conditions, I'm feeling relatively secure with about 35% of my net worth currently in cash, which positions me well to re-enter when I believe we're bottoming out.\n\nI'm noticing I've been smoking more recently, which is something I need to curtail this week. I'm planning to try ZYN as a nicotine substitute to help with this. The crypto accounting with Zach remains unfinished despite completing the tax loss harvesting, so finalizing this is a priority.\n\nI did manage a long run on Sunday which felt really good - a bright spot in an otherwise challenging week. I've also started playing \"Stella by Starlight\" on the piano and working on transposing it into different keys, beginning with C major, which I think of as a substitute for E flat. Additionally, I began working with Claude to put together a diet and workout plan, which marks a positive step toward healthier habits. The plan suggests I should increase my caloric intake, which I need to explore further.\n\nLooking forward, I need to focus on building my profile and credibility in the AI space. This could involve starting a substack or producing written content. Building an audience would support potential pivots into PE opportunities, fundraising, or even consultancy work through atchai.",
    "Emotional State": "Rating: 3 out of 5\nWhy this rating?: The market downturn and Oscar's illness have been stressful, but I'm feeling relatively stable due to my cash position (35% of net worth) which provides security. I'm concerned about my increased smoking habit and need to address this. The long run on Sunday provided a mental boost.",
