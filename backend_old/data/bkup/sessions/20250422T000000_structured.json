    "Open Reflection": "The past couple of weeks have felt rather unproductive. This past weekend was spent in Bristol seeing extended family at Bob's, which was a pleasant experience. It's reassuring that Oscar is doing better - he's happier, walking more with his walker (though not yet unassisted), and babbling a lot without clear words but seems to be trying to say things.\n\nThere's a lack of clear direction professionally right now. The market is down and difficult to trade effectively during this period of uncertainty with Trump's policies causing market hesitation. The momentum edge seems lost, and funding arbitrage isn't yielding as much as before. While the Bera ecosystem might offer high yields (around 200% APY), the reward tokens are already inflated in value, meaning it would take about 3 months of yields just to break even - making it too late to profitably enter this strategy.\n\nCurrently sitting with about 35% of net worth in cash, positioned for a mean reversion strategy. While Bitcoin appears to be breaking out, it seems unlikely to reach new highs without a proper return to risk-on sentiment, which would require equities to turn around first. Planning to make strategic buys once the market drops below the 2021 highs in equities, when panic selling might create opportunities. The approach is to remain calm and buy gradually through the end of the year.\n\nEven with political volatility, the market will eventually adapt. We may continue drifting downward into a recession, but once a recession is officially announced, that's likely near the bottom and could be a good time to start buying - probably within 6 months of the actual bottom. Maintaining a decent cash position allows flexibility to buy into dips.\n\nFor stability and family wellbeing, establishing an income stream is important. This means potentially speaking with Connor about opportunities, focusing on building a business rather than just taking a job - though consulting work could be part of the business portfolio. The PE market appears to be facing challenges, but conversations with Simon and connections through FEDs Discord could provide better market insights.\n\nCurrently managing an SPX short position initiated at 5300 with some hedging, considering taking profits on the futures short while maintaining the put options.\n\nAnother concern impacting emotional wellbeing is my father's apparent inability to manage his Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) through dietary changes, which became evident during this weekend's visit. I need to accept that his health choices are ultimately in his hands, and focus instead on aspects of life I can control.\n\nOn the productive side, I've been doing quite a bit of coding lately, working on a Lighter API (currently blocked waiting for API access) to farm the Lighter exchange. I'm also developing an AI journaling app concept based on this journaling process.",
    "Emotional State": "Rating: 2.5 out of 5\nWhy this rating?: Feeling low energy after returning to London late last night. Lacking clear professional direction and concerned about difficult market conditions. Additionally, concern about my father's health management choices is weighing on me, though I'm trying to focus on what I can control.",
