## 20-Day Journal Entries

### Week 1: Documenting the Reality

**Day 1 - Monday**
*"Crazy Monday. Had to review 2 angel deals by EOD - both interesting companies but struggled to focus. Started researching the founders, ended up spending 2 hours reading about the competitive landscape and getting anxious about how fast the space is moving. Benjamin wanted to show me his new puzzle but I was deep in spreadsheets. Finally played with him before bed and he was so excited - made me realize I'd been stressed about deals all day that I'm probably not even going to invest in. Still have 47 startup ideas in my notes app that I've never properly evaluated. When am I going to find time to think about which ones I'd actually want to spend the next 5 years building?"*

**Day 2 - Tuesday**
*"Great run this morning, had another startup idea - #48 now. It's a good one about B2B subscription analytics, but honestly, do I even care about subscription analytics? Or am I just pattern matching from successful companies? No framework for filtering these ideas by what I'd actually enjoy working on vs what seems valuable. Sarah asked what I want for my birthday next month. Told her 'just some time to think through life stuff.' She pointed out I have evenings and weekends but I fill them with 'urgent' work that's not really urgent. She's right."*

**Day 3 - Wednesday**
*"Mom called worried about dad's memory issues. Spent my lunch break and another hour after work researching memory care facilities, but I'm no closer to knowing if we should move them closer. What information would actually help me make this decision? Keep getting lost in facility reviews instead of talking to them about what they want. Meanwhile, my team is waiting on the Q2 roadmap and I keep pushing it off. Told them EOD today but that's not happening. After Benjamin went to bed, spent an hour scrolling Twitter seeing all these founders crushing it. Makes me feel like I'm falling behind, but behind in what exactly?"*

**Day 4 - Thursday**  
*"Looked at my todo list today and laughed. 'Buy printer ink' - done. 'Schedule dentist' - done. 'Submit expense report' - done. But 'Figure out startup timeline'? Been there since January. 'Make decision on parents'? Three months. 'Create angel investing thesis'? Six months. I'm optimizing for quick wins instead of tackling the hard decisions. What do I actually need to know to move forward on these? Maybe that's the real question."*

**Day 5 - Friday**
*"Rough team meeting. Jake presented a really thoughtful feature proposal and I picked it apart pretty harshly. Saw his enthusiasm drain away. I think I'm taking my frustration about my own indecision out on the team. They're doing great work and I'm being the bottleneck. After the meeting, spent an hour on LinkedIn looking at other PMs who became founders. The comparison game is toxic but I can't stop. Need to get off this hamster wheel."*

**Day 6 - Saturday**
*"Family Saturday but I checked my phone constantly. Sarah called me out when I said 'just need to check one thing' for the fifth time. When I finally put it in the other room and built a train track with Benjamin, I felt more present than I have all week. He was so happy to have my full attention. We played for two hours straight and I had more creative ideas than I do in most meetings. Maybe presence is the secret sauce?"*

**Day 7 - Sunday**
*"Finally played piano tonight - first time in two months. Just 20 minutes but it felt like coming home. Sarah came in and listened, said she missed hearing me play. Then the guilt hit - should be reviewing those deals, working on startup ideas, planning parent stuff. But you know what? After playing, I actually solved a product problem that's been bugging me all week. Maybe taking breaks isn't unproductive after all?"*

### Week 2: Pattern Recognition Begins

**Day 8 - Monday**
*"Interesting observation: looked back at my calendar and every 'strategic' decision I've scheduled after 2pm has been a disaster. But I keep putting important thinking time in the afternoon because mornings are 'for meetings.' Backwards. Also caught myself - opened LinkedIn 12 times before lunch. Each time was 'just for a second' but I'd emerge 20-30 minutes later feeling inadequate. The phone is becoming a problem."*

**Day 9 - Tuesday**
*"Morning run, another idea (#49). Tried to voice memo it but spent 6 minutes explaining context and forgot the main point. But here's the thing - looking at my list, I don't even like half these ideas. I'm writing them down because they seem 'valuable' or 'scalable.' What if I only pursued ideas I'd be excited to work on even if they failed? That would eliminate like 40 of them instantly. Team meeting went well today - I mostly listened instead of talking. Correlation?"*

**Day 10 - Wednesday**
*"Dedicated 90 minutes to research parent care options. Still spinning wheels. I have 15 browser tabs open with facility comparisons but haven't asked mom and dad what they actually want. What would help me make a decision? Budget constraints? Their preferences? Timeline? Benjamin interrupted my research spiral wanting to play. After 20 minutes of playing, I realized I was overthinking this. Need to just talk to my parents directly."*

**Day 11 - Thursday**
*"Tried new approach with team - be more collaborative. Overcorrected and agreed to feature requests we definitely can't deliver this quarter. There's a middle ground between dictatorial and pushover. Had an angel deal call during Benjamin's bedtime story time. Told Sarah 'just 15 minutes' but it went for an hour. She didn't say anything but the silence was loud. When I'm present with family, work problems feel manageable. When I'm distracted, everything feels urgent and nothing gets done well."*

**Day 12 - Friday**
*"Did an audit: 49 startup ideas, zero validated. 6 angel deals 'considering,' only 1 I'm genuinely excited about. 23 books on my 'must read' list, finished 0 this year. But my email is at inbox zero! Clearly focusing on the wrong metrics. Maybe what I need isn't more ideas but a thought partner? Someone who's good at execution while I'm good at vision? Or maybe I just need to pick ONE idea based on what energizes me, not what might have the biggest exit."*

**Day 13 - Saturday**
*"Good morning - wrote in my journal for 30 minutes straight, felt amazing. Then 'quickly' checked Twitter. Two hours gone. Saw three announcements of startups doing variations of my ideas. Instead of motivating me, it paralyzed me. Sarah took Benjamin to the park and I said I'd catch up after 'one email.' Never made it to the park. They came back and Benjamin said 'Daddy working?' - he's starting to notice patterns. That hurt."*

**Day 14 - Sunday**
*"Tried to play piano but kept getting Slack notifications. Not urgent ones - someone sharing an article, team chatting about weekend plans. But each one pulled me out of the music. Finally turned phone to airplane mode. Played for 45 minutes. Sarah brought me tea, Benjamin danced to the music. This is what weekends should be. Why do I let the digital noise drown out what matters?"*

### Week 3: Early Changes

**Day 15 - Monday**
*"Experiment: blocked 6-8am for 'creative thinking,' no phone allowed. Only lasted until 6:23am before checking email. But those 23 minutes? Had my clearest thinking in weeks. Mapped out a framework for evaluating my startup ideas. Afternoon was all meetings and admin - actually perfect for my lower energy. Why have I been fighting my natural rhythm? Evening with family, no phone at dinner. Benjamin told a whole story about his day. I actually heard it."*

**Day 16 - Tuesday**
*"Workout revelation: I don't have an angel deal evaluation problem, I have a saying no problem. Every 'quick call' turns into 2-hour due diligence because I can't admit early it's not a fit. Need a framework: only invest in industries I understand and founders I'd want to work with. That eliminates 4 of the 6 current deals. Benjamin said 'Daddy play trains?' right as I was about to take a call. Chose trains. Deal can wait."*

**Day 17 - Wednesday**
*"Put 'parent planning' on calendar 10-11am. Actually used it to call them and ask direct questions. Mom was surprised but grateful. They want to stay in their home as long as possible but are open to moving closer in a year. There - more progress in one conversation than three months of research. Team shipped a feature while I was on parent call. They didn't need me hovering. Interesting."*

**Day 18 - Thursday**
*"Team crushed the sprint demo. I mostly stayed quiet and let Jake lead. He's ready for more responsibility. If I delegate better, I could free up 5-6 hours per week. For what though? That's the real question. Had startup idea during team celebration - didn't write it down. Not because I forgot, but because it wasn't that good. Growth? Benjamin and I read books before bed. He fell asleep on my chest. These moments matter more than any cap table."*

**Day 19 - Friday**
*"Date night with Sarah. She asked what I really want from life. Started rambling about startup potential and market opportunities. She stopped me: 'Not what could be successful. What do you want?' Sat in silence for a bit. Finally said: 'I want Benjamin to have a dad who's present. Want you to have a husband who's not always stressed. Want to build something I'm proud of, even if it's not a unicorn.' She smiled. 'Then why all the noise?' Good question."*

**Day 20 - Saturday**
*"Great family morning at the farmers market. Kept phone in car. Benjamin tried every sample, Sarah and I actually talked. Afternoon: reviewed my startup list with new filter - 'Would I be excited to work on this for 5 years even if it stayed small?' Down to 3 ideas. Progress. Evening: angel investor mixer. Stayed for one hour instead of three. Home for Benjamin's bedtime. He said 'Daddy home!' like it was a surprise. Need to make it not a surprise."*

**Day 21 - Sunday**
*"Long piano session - full hour. No interruptions. Sarah read on the couch, Benjamin played with blocks. Peaceful. Had a startup idea midway through but kept playing. Idea was still there after, wrote it down in 30 seconds. Maybe ideas don't need essays, just capture. Looking at the week ahead - what if I blocked mornings for deep work, afternoons for meetings, evenings for family? What if I said no to 80% of opportunities to say yes to the 20% that matter? What if 'enough' is enough?"*

## Expected Insights to Extract

1. **Family Time as Clarity Generator**
   - Quality time with family provides perspective on what's truly important
   - Being present with Benjamin and Sarah reduces work stress
   - Family moments ground him and cut through the "noise"

2. **Piano as Recharge Mechanism**
   - Playing piano helps mental reset and creative problem-solving
   - Musical practice provides escape from productivity guilt
   - Regular piano time correlates with better mood and clarity

3. **Idea Overload Without Execution**
   - 49+ startup ideas but no validation framework
   - Needs co-founder for execution or framework for elimination
   - Should filter ideas by personal interest/passion, not just market opportunity

4. **Phone and Social Media Distraction**
   - Phone checking leads to comparison spirals and time loss
   - LinkedIn/Twitter creates false urgency and inadequacy
   - Morning phone-free time dramatically improves thinking quality

5. **Urgent vs Important Confusion**
   - Todo lists full of trivial tasks while big decisions stagnate
   - Needs to delegate urgent-but-not-important work
   - Must identify and focus on what truly matters

6. **Decision Paralysis**
   - Procrastinating on major decisions (parents, startup, investments)
   - Needs to identify what information would actually enable decisions
   - One conversation often worth more than endless research

7. **Daily Schedule Optimization**
   - Mornings (6-8am) best for creative/strategic work
   - Afternoons (2-5pm) better for admin/meetings
   - Evenings should be protected for family time

8. **Priority and Focus**
   - Trying to do everything means nothing gets done well
   - Needs to choose top 20% of opportunities and let 80% go
   - "Enough" might actually be enough
