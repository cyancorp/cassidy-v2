Manage Demo Journal Entries - Local and Production
==================================================

This script can:
1. Delete existing journal entries for the test user
2. Create strategic demo entries that showcase productivity insights
3. Work with both local SQLite and production PostgreSQL
4. Handle environment detection automatically

Usage:
    # Local development (uses local SQLite)
    uv run python scripts/manage_demo_entries.py --reset-demo
    
    # Production (uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL)
    uv run python scripts/manage_demo_entries.py --reset-demo --production
    
    # Just view current entries
    uv run python scripts/manage_demo_entries.py --list
    
    # Delete only (without adding new)
    uv run python scripts/manage_demo_entries.py --delete-only
