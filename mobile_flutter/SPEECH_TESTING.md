# Speech-to-Text Improvements Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **ContinuousSpeechService**
- **Location**: `lib/services/continuous_speech_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic restarts every 85 seconds (before iOS 90s timeout)
  - Silence detection with 30-second timeout
  - Text accumulation across restart cycles
  - Proper error handling and recovery
  - Haptic and audio feedback

### 2. **Enhanced Permissions**
- **Android**: Added missing `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **iOS**: Already had proper permissions in `Info.plist`

### 3. **Audio Session Configuration**
- Added `audio_session` package for better iOS audio handling
- Configured speech-optimized audio session

### 4. **Updated Dependencies**
- Added `audio_session: ^0.1.16` to `pubspec.yaml`

## Key Improvements

### **Problem Solved**: iOS Speech Framework 60-second timeout
- **Old behavior**: Speech would stop after ~60 seconds even with 10-minute timeout setting
- **New behavior**: Continuous recognition with seamless automatic restarts

### **Better Text Handling**
- Accumulates text across restart cycles
- Preserves partial results during transitions
- Handles pauses naturally without losing context

### **Enhanced Error Recovery**
- Automatic retry on network issues
- Graceful handling of permission issues
- Better user feedback on errors

## Testing Instructions

### **1. Basic Functionality Test**
1. Open the Flutter app
2. Navigate to chat screen
3. Tap microphone button
4. Speak for 10-15 seconds
5. **Expected**: Text appears in real-time, microphone stays active

### **2. Long Duration Test**
1. Start speech recognition
2. Speak for 2-3 minutes with natural pauses
3. **Expected**: 
   - No interruptions at 60-90 second mark
   - Text continues to accumulate
   - Seamless transitions during automatic restarts

### **3. Silence Handling Test**
1. Start speech recognition
2. Speak for 10 seconds, then stay silent for 35+ seconds
3. Speak again
4. **Expected**: Recognition resumes automatically after silence

### **4. Pause and Resume Test**
1. Start speaking
2. Tap microphone to stop
3. Tap microphone again to resume
4. Continue speaking
5. **Expected**: New speech appends to existing text

### **5. Error Recovery Test**
1. Start speech recognition
2. Put device in airplane mode briefly
3. Turn airplane mode off
4. **Expected**: Service recovers automatically

## Configuration Options

### **Timing Settings** (in `continuous_speech_service.dart`)
```dart
// Restart before iOS timeout
static const Duration _restartInterval = Duration(seconds: 85);

// Restart if silent too long  
static const Duration _silenceTimeout = Duration(seconds: 30);

// Individual session length
static const Duration _listenFor = Duration(seconds: 90);

// Pause detection
static const Duration _pauseFor = Duration(seconds: 5);
```

### **Adjustable Parameters**
- **_restartInterval**: How often to restart (should be < 90s for iOS)
- **_silenceTimeout**: How long to wait during silence before restart
- **_pauseFor**: How long a pause before considering speech "done"

## Troubleshooting

### **If Speech Stops After 60 Seconds**
- Check iOS device settings for speech recognition permissions
- Verify `audio_session` is properly initialized
- Check console logs for restart messages

### **If Text Gets Cut Off**
- Check `_buildAccumulatedText()` method for proper text joining
- Verify final results are being processed correctly

### **If Permissions Fail**
- **iOS**: Check `Info.plist` has speech and microphone permissions
- **Android**: Verify `AndroidManifest.xml` has `RECORD_AUDIO` permission
- Test with `permission_handler` package for runtime permissions

### **If Audio Session Fails**
- Check device supports speech recognition
- Verify no other apps are using microphone exclusively
- Test with device restart if persistent issues

## Performance Monitoring

### **Console Logs to Watch**
```
Speech service initialized: true
Started new listening session
Final result: [text]
Accumulated: [full text]
Restarting speech recognition...
```

### **Debug Mode Features**
- Detailed logging of restart cycles
- Error messages with full stack traces
- Timing information for each session

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Custom Wake Word Detection**: Add always-listening mode
2. **Offline Speech Recognition**: Use on-device processing when available
3. **Voice Activity Detection**: More intelligent silence detection
4. **Multi-language Support**: Dynamic locale switching
5. **Cloud Speech APIs**: Integration with Google/Azure for better accuracy

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert by:
1. Replace `ContinuousSpeechService` import with original `speech_to_text`
2. Restore original `_startListening()` and `_stopListening()` methods
3. Remove `audio_session` dependency from `pubspec.yaml`
4. Keep Android permissions (they were missing originally)

## Performance Impact

- **Memory**: Minimal increase (~50KB for service)
- **Battery**: Slightly higher due to continuous operation, but offset by more efficient restarts
- **Network**: Same as before (depends on speech service used)
- **CPU**: Negligible impact from restart logic
